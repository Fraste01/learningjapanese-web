# Learning Japanese

This application is a small project made by 3 parts:
 - Web
 - Backend
 - Database
In the future I will add an Flutter application.

I'm making this application mainly to learn japanese, but also for me to learn and consolidate the use of Python with Flesk, React and MongoDB.
I will try to release a full version of this application in the future on some server/cloud if I see some interest.
In the first real working version will have 4 main sections:
 - Kanji (with flashcards)
 - Grammar
 - Dictionary
 - Quiz

If anyone is interested to help you can contact me directly.
